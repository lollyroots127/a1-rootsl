    <!-- 1. Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers. -->
    <p>This file is named <code>index.html</code>, and it is the <strong>designated homepage</strong> of the <code>rootsl/a1-rootsl</code> directory located on the OSU Engineering
    web server. When a web browser sends an HTTP request for the directory, the <strong>Apache</strong> web server, the software used by OSU Engineering, maps the request to this file. 
    The majority of web servers are configured to search for an <code>index.html</code> file whenever they receive a request for <code>/</code>, the <strong>root directory</strong>. On some web servers, 
    other file names are accepted as homepages. For example, Microsoft web servers will also look for <code>default.html</code> files.</p>
